Description: ChemmineR is an R package for analyzing small molecule and screening data. The new version of the package 'ChemmineR-V2' contains efficient functions and data containers for processing SDFs (structure data files), structural similarity searching, clustering/diversity analyses of compound libraries with a wide spectrum of algorithms, and utilities for managing complex data sets from high-throughput compound bio-assays. In addition, it offers visualization functions for compound clustering results and chemical structures. The integration of chemoinformatic tools with the R programming environment has many advantages, such as easy access to a wide spectrum of statistical methods, machine learning algorithms and graphic utilities.
